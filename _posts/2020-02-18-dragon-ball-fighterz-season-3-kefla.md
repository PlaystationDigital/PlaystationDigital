Bandai Namco recently published Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, but that isn’t stopping the company from supporting 2018’s Dragon Ball FighterZ. FighterZ will be getting a new season of content at the end of the month featuring an updated battle system, training mode, and additional character named Kefla. This character is a fusion of Kale and Caulifla as part of the Dragon Ball Super series and is considered to be an all-powerful foe—more so than Goku in his Super Saiyan God form.

Thanks to [Siliconera](https://www.siliconera.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-shares-details-for-kefla-new-battle-system-features-and-new-practice-training-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dragon-ball-fighterz-shares-details-for-kefla-new-battle-system-features-and-new-practice-training-mode) for the translation from [Ryokutya2089.](http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/28731) Here’s what to expect from Kefla:

<ul>
<li>Special Attacks: “Fast Cannon Ball,” “Gigantic Breaker”</li>
<li>Super Special Attack: “Gigantic Ray” – Shoots opponents with a bunch of Ki blasts in mid-air.</li>
<li>Meteor Attack: “Gigantic Boost”</li>
</ul>

Dragon Ball FighterZ is also getting some new battle system features.

<ul>
<li>Z Assist Select: This allows players to select a character’s Assist Attack. Each character has three different Assist Attacks to choose from.</li>
<li>Limit Break Super Power: When you have one character remaining the meter changes to a golden color that automatically provides a huge boost in attack power. You can also use this together with Sparking.</li>
</ul>

And finally, Season 3’s new training mode will allow other in-game characters to serve as your “sensei” to train, and completing training tasks will grant rewards for players, giving a good inventive to jump into training.

Dragon Ball FighterZ Season 3 will go live on February 28, 2020, for all players, while those who own the game’s Pass 3 will gain early access to Kefla on February 26, 2020.
