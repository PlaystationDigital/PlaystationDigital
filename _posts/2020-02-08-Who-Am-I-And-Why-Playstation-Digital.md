I'm very excited to start a website based on my passion of playing and talking about video games!

# Who Am I?
Welp my name is Gabriel. I am the oldest of 9, Born in Denver, Colorado. Grew up in Guamuchil, Sinaloa. And now reside in Fresno, California. I’ve been moving around most of my life, my family has always been spread out between the U.S. and Mexico. But throughout all the ups and downs of being a first generation Mexican-American video games have remained the one thing that truly stayed with me wherever i went.

My first memory of gaming is Staying up very late at night watching my Dad play Spider-Man on the ps1, he was playing the last level of the game (something my 7 year old brain didn't realize at the time) as he was trying to run away from Carnage Doctor Octopus… and let me tell you something. This anxiety inducing douche nugget:

Was very hard to beat, so hard my dad gave up and handed me the controller and told me “if you beat him wake me up” i was shocked to see my dad give up on spidey, but i was assigned a mission. Queue to me trying my best in a situation where the controls were clunky and worsened by the bad camera angles. We ended up never seeing the credits from that game. The Ps2 has a place in my heart along with the GameCube (nintendo products were always around because family members had them, like the nintendo 64, super nintendo, gameboy color & advance so that part of my childhood was not lacking) it was games like Shrek 2, SpongeBob: the movie: the game, and the cult classic Spongebob: battle for bikini bottom that made me happy in times were i needed it the most. Even games like xiaolin showdown’s cartoon from WB kids which we grew up watching on the weekends in the half semester we attended school in Phoenix, Arizona. That was also around the time I got obsessed with Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.
Growing up playstation has always been a part of my life, but how couldn't when we got an xbox 360 it had the red ring of death and for someone like my mom, who did not know the first thing about consoles... felt like a slap to the face and she completely lost trust on xbox that generation. So we ended up with a ps3 thanks to my dad’s ex wife getting him one for christmas. My brother and I decided to beg him for it till he caved… and gambled it  over a match of FIFA (he loves Football/Soccer) lucky for us he’s really bad at memorizing control schemes. And just like that the ps3 fell on our hands, his ex-wife probably hated us for it but oh well… I also had a ps vita and it came with marvel vs capcom 3, and oh boy! going to the corner stores that had arcade machine or two was the next best thing to arcade stores in the U.S. considering I never went to one here but at least i had the nickel Arcade in Fresno to try to fill that hole in my life.I played the heck out of my ps vita, i probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't for the fact that memory cards were super expensive and me being in a developing third world country was not helping. I came to the U.S. my first year of highschool knowing little english that i learned from games like fall out and skyrim and watching my favorite youtubers at the time The creatures (Rip), play videogames we couldnt afford. During my sophomore year we managed to get a destiny glacier white ps4 which was one of the best consoles experiences we’ve had, Now from this point onward i'm going to write about the good times and bad times that have happened during this generation.
# Why Playstation Digital?
You might ask “why is the site called PlayStationDigital.com” well... that’s because I’m very keen on buying my video games digitally and also because gaming on PlayStation is my main source of entertainment. the story behind why I chose to go digital goes all the way back to the PlayStation 2 days when you could got to a local game store or a Walmart of all things and i would beg my mom to get me a new game. Any new game i could get my hands on I would play till 100% completion and just grinded the hell out of. But that was if had the chance to do so... picture my family of 5 (At the time..) I’m the oldest, my brother Arturo is the second oldest and from there it goes all girls Julieth, Michelle, and Sheyla. You see, I loved going to school and coming back to all little sisters using my video game cases to form bridges between their pillow forts. literally stepping all over the game cases to get to the other side, with any game that happened to be inside getting caught in the stampede of a reckless game of tag. Yes many tears were shed and belt whoopings given… to everyone (even me). So aside from the breaking of games you can also imagine the scratching that would happen inside cases after the disc got loose from abuse. But that didn't compare to the worst thing that could happen to your favorite videogame… The disc getting stolen, for some reason while growing up, my video games always ended up stolen. I would open my disc folder and realize a game in my precious collection was gone… sooner or later I would find it in my local video game store just staring at me in the face behind lock and key. I never truly found the culprit. It could've been my brother, my cousins, my uncle (who we pretty much blamed for everything because he was a user and threatened to make us kneel on bricks any other day.. Thank god he never saw a lego in his life) not long after many painful games of mine being stolen sometimes not even days after i got them, the Sony hack of 2011 happened and I got infamous and dead nation from the welcome back digital games selection. These games couldn't be scratched, stolen or borrowed. Not only that but at the time you could activate your account on 5 different ps3’s meaning that you technically had 5 copies of the same game to be shared with people you cared about and play the multiplayer aspect of games with them as well. From there it became a habit to do the same with PS4 games, although a bit more strict on the rules of digital media, getting a digital version of a game meant getting 2 copies of it on PS4. All of the above is why i decided to stop getting physical games, the last thing to adress is if i have all of my games downloaded?  And the answer to that question is yes, yes i do. On a 5 TB hard drive, i feel like that is my collection. Some people collect books, shoes or cars. I collect videogames.
