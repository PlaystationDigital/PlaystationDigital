# New Operators, Oregeon map rework, gameplay updates and more detailed.

Operation Void Edge is coming to Rainbow Six Siege on PS4, bringing two new Operators and a rework of the Oregon map to the tense, tactical first-person shooter, and kicking off its fifth year of new Operators, map reworks, gameplay updates, and live support.

A new Attacker named Iana will introduce a hologram that looks, sounds, and moves just like her, while a new Defender named Oryx can straight-up crash through breakable walls using only his prodigious muscles. In addition to these impactful new Operators, Operation Void Edge will also bring gameplay refinements and Operator-balancing changes that will be free for all players.
