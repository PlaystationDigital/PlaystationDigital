Predator: Hunting Grounds will be coming to PlayStation 4 and PC on 24th April 2020, with a pre-order granting access to items inspired by the original 1987 movie, including the exclusive '87 Predator Skin and early access to the Ole Painless mini-gun. If you ain't got time to bleed, find the time to watch the latest Predator.

As the Predator, you'll need to be stealthy, using acrobatics to leap through the jungle canopy, while using alien tech like the deadly Plasmacaster and heat vision to track his prey. The opposing Fireteam will need to take down bad guys and recover important items as the Predator closes in, ready to ambush his prey.

The footage, which we've embedded below, gives us a glimpse from both the human's eye view, and the Predator's side, and you'll be pleased to know the Predator has his various vision modes and plenty of signature weapons for you to hunt your friends with should you be playing as the titular hunter.

While the Fireteam's troopers will be armed with a state-of-the-art arsenal of pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, grenades, and heavy weapons, the Predator will have his thermal vision for spotting targets amid the jungle foliage, as well as the ability to cloak and blend in with the undergrowth. Several conflict zones across South America will serve as the eponymous hunting grounds, as you decide whether to split up as a Fireteam, or stay together to achieve your objectives.
