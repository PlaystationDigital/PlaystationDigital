The video starts out with a look at some action from new playable characters. It includes Izuku Midoriya Full Cowl 100%, Overhaul Version 2, Gang Orca, Seiji Shishikura and Camie Utsushimi.

Next, the video showcases Mission Mode that requires making your very own Hero Office. In this mode you recruit various characters, both heroes and villains, to make your own unique teams.

Arcade Mode puts you head-to-head against various characters. What makes this mode unique is that it has original conversations for all the characters. In Player Customize you can create and customize your own Player Cards.

Lastly, Story Mode will let you experience the story through two different perspectives between heroes and villains. The “Hero Side” and “Villain Side” show parts of the story we didn’t see in the original work.

My Hero One’s Justice 2 will release for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch in Japan on March 12, 2020 for 7,600 yen. Moreover, will release for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam worldwide on March 13, 2020.
