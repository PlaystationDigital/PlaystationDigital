Nations form an alliance to create the World Space Agency, a team tasked with resolving the world's energy crisis, starting with the colonisation of the Moon to extract its reserves of Helium-3. However, when communications from the Moon stop and the energy source is lost, you're left in darkness without power, as back on Earth, governments scramble around for a way to re-connect the energy supply and return hope to mankind.
