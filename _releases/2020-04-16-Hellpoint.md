Publisher tinyBuild has announced that Hellpoint, a sci-fi Souls-like from developer Cradle Games, is coming to PS4 on 16th April 2020.

Described as "an intense, dark sci-fi RPG set of a derelict space station", it looks a lot like Dead Space meets Dark Souls, with all of the space-priests and resurrected space human zombie things that you'd expect to find in a Dead Space game. The devs also claim to take inspiration from films such as Event Horizon and Hellraiser. All things considered, it looks pretty good.

Co-op is a big part of the game, with both online and split-screen co-op available, and the narrative involves "cosmic gods, quantum physics and extinct space civilisations". You can check out the latest trailer down below!
