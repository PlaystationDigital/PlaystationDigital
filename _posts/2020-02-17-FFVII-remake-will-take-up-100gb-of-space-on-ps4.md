Square Enix has confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Remake will take up a massive 100GB on PS4. Previously the Japanese publisher said that the game will take up an entire 2 Blu-Ray discs and that remains true.

While exact sizes for Xbox and PC arenâ€™t confirmed (as they are only publicly talking about the PS4 version until the year exclusivity is up), it is safe to save both platforms will cost more space due to resolution and graphical quality enhancements.
