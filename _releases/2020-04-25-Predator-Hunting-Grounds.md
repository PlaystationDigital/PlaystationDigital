Predator: Hunting Grounds will be coming to PlayStation 4 and PC on 24th April 2020, with a pre-order granting access to items inspired by the original 1987 movie, including the exclusive '87 Predator Skin and early access to the Ole Painless mini-gun. If you ain't got time to bleed, find the time to watch the latest Predator.

As the Predator, you'll need to be stealthy, using acrobatics to leap through the jungle canopy, while using alien tech like the deadly Plasmacaster and heat vision to track his prey. The opposing Fireteam will need to take down bad guys and recover important items as the Predator closes in, ready to ambush his prey.
