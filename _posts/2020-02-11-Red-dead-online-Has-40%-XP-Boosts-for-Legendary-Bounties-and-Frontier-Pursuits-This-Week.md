## ADDITIONAL BONUSES & BENEFITS MOONSHINER PROPERTY DISCOUNTS AND MORE.

If your purse strings are tight, there are plenty of ways to save coin in Red Dead Online. Moonshiners can take 25% off the price of all Moonshiner Properties (including property relocation fees). Upgrade your property with a Bar Expansion to entertain friends and serve Marcel's masterfully crafted Moonshine in, then decorate with customizable Bar Themes.

Elsewhere, you can take 5 Gold Bars off the Bounty Hunter License, Butcher Table and Collector's Bag. If you're looking to establish your camp, take 30% off the Stew Pot and Weapons Locker -- both should help you fend for yourself out in the wilderness.

PlayStation Plus members receive 3 Free Mash Refills and Trader Resupplies this week, and those Red Dead Online players who connected their Social Club account with Twitch Prime will receive the Collector's Bag and Polished Copper Moonshine Still, both free of charge (visit Twitch Prime to sign up). 

Check Rockstar Support for details and limitations.
